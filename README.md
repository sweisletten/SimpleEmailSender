#SimpleEmailSender

Hello my name is Spencer, I am a beginner programmer and Python is my first programming language. Any comments or advice would gladly be accepted.

For this project I wanted to learn how to write a email sender that I could implement into other programs. I used the smtplib module and tried to implement a secure SSL connection, but I'm not sure if I did it correctly. I did try to use TLS instead but for some reson it wouldn't connect to the smtp.gmail.com server.

#How to use

1: To run this program you must have the smtplib module in your environment which can be downloaded with "pip3 install smtplib". 

2: This program is setup for gmail accounts so a unsecured gmail account must be used. 

3: Anti-virus and firewall softwares may block the email or send it to your junk folder.
